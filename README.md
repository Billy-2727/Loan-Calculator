# Loan-Calculator

This calculator application is made to give the user an easy to read and understand view of the loan that thay may potentially be thinking of taking out.

I chose to use Materialize for this project as it looked to have a clean form that I could use to get user inputs as well as a diverse amount of ways that I could potentially output the results of the calculation.

Using Materialize gave me an oppertunity to gain knowledge on how the grid system works within it as well as how to add components that are pre-built into the webpage.

The clean UI allows the user to easily see what infomation they need to input, once the information has been entered the cards below the form then display the outputs that result from the inputs that the user gives.
